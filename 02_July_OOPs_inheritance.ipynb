    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) of another class (called the superclass or base class). Inheritance facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where more specialized classes inherit the characteristics of more general classes. This promotes code reusability, modularity, and the creation of a more organized and structured codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to create a new class by reusing the attributes and methods of an existing class. Instead of rewriting the same code for similar functionality, you can extend an existing class to add or modify specific behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchy and Specialization: In a program, you often have a set of classes that share common attributes and methods but also have some differences. Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes where subclasses can specialize or override certain behaviors while inheriting the common ones from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modularity and Maintainability: Inheritance promotes modularity by separating different aspects of a program's functionality into different classes. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend because changes made to the superclass are automatically inherited by all its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely tied to the concept of polymorphism, where different objects of related classes can be treated as instances of a common superclass. This enables more flexible and abstract programming, as you can write code that works with general types and can be applied to specific subclasses as well.\n",
    "\n",

    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one parent class. This means that a child class can have only one immediate superclass. This approach encourages a simpler and more linear class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: Single inheritance enforces a clear and straightforward hierarchy. It's easier to understand the relationships between classes when there's only one parent-child connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduced Complexity: With only one parent class, potential issues related to ambiguity and conflicts in method and attribute resolution are minimized. It's generally easier to manage and debug the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Reusability: Single inheritance still promotes code reusability by allowing you to create a base class with common attributes and behaviors that can be inherited by multiple subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple sources. Each parent class contributes its own set of features to the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rich Functionality: Multiple inheritance allows you to combine features from multiple sources, creating classes with diverse functionalities. This can lead to more flexible and feature-rich designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity and Mixins: You can use multiple inheritance to create specialized classes known as \"mixins.\" These mixins can encapsulate specific features or behaviors and can be combined to construct complex classes without having to reimplement the same behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fine-Grained Specialization: With multiple inheritance, you can achieve fine-grained specialization by inheriting only the relevant features from different parent classes. This can result in more efficient and targeted designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference between single inheritance and multiple inheritance lies in the number of parent classes a child class can have:\n",

    "- Multiple Inheritance: A child class can have more than one parent class."

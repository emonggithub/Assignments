    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a structured and modular approach to designing and organizing software. OOP is centered around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit. The main objectives of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity: OOP allows you to break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable components (objects) that interact with each other. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). This encapsulation hides the internal details of an object's implementation from the outside world, promoting information hiding and reducing the risk of unintended interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Abstraction allows you to create simplified models of real-world entities in your software. It involves defining essential characteristics and ignoring the non-essential details. This helps developers focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (subclasses or derived classes) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses or base classes). This promotes code reuse and the establishment of hierarchies that model real-world relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables code to be written in a more generic way, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism is often associated with method overriding and interfaces/abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to facilitate the development of more organized, modular, and maintainable software through the use of objects, classes, and their associated principles. By modeling software after real-world objects and their interactions, OOP aims to make code easier to understand, modify, and expand over time."

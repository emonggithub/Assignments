    "An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a value. In other words, it represents a computation that returns a result. Expressions can be simple, such as a single constant value, or complex, involving multiple operations and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression can be made up of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Literals: These are fixed values, such as numbers or strings, that are directly written in the expression. For example, in the expression 2 + 3, both 2 and 3 are literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables: These are names that represent a memory location where a value is stored. Variables can hold different data types (e.g., integers, strings) and can be used in expressions. For example, if we have a variable x, the expression x + 5 uses the value stored in x and adds 5 to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Operators: Operators are symbols or reserved words that represent specific operations. Examples of operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), and logical operators (and, or, not).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Function calls: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. When you call a function in an expression, it can return a value that becomes part of the expression's evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can be used for various purposes in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment: Expressions can be used to assign values to variables. For example, x = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculation: Expressions are commonly used to perform calculations. For example, 2 + 3 evaluates to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conditionals: Expressions are used in conditional statements to determine the flow of a program. For example, in an if statement, the expression inside the parentheses determines whether the code block is executed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Looping: Expressions are used in loop constructs to control the repetition of a block of code. For example, in a for loop, the expression controls the range or conditions for iteration."

    "A statement is a complete instruction or command that performs an action. It can include expressions, but its primary purpose is to carry out a specific task or action in a program. Statements can be simple or compound (containing multiple expressions or other statements).\n",
    "Examples of statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assignment statement: x = 10 (assigns the value 10 to the variable x)\n",
    "- Conditional statement: if x > 0: (checks if the condition x > 0 is true and executes the following block of code if it is)\n",
